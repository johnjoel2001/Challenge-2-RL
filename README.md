# Challenge 2 RL
Train and evaluate a deep RL agent (e.g., PPO or DQN) in a stochastic, procedurally generated environment (e.g., MiniGrid, ProcGen, or Unity ML-Agents). You must identify a failure mode (reward hacking, poor generalization, adversarial exploitation) and propose a mitigation strategy.
